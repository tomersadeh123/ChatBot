## Job Projects
I owned the design and implementation of third-party automation solutions, building 4 distinct workflows that replaced manual handoffs and reduced onboarding time by automating the entire process from lead to activation.


1. Monday Job (ETL Orchestration)
  - Developed a comprehensive ETL system that extracts data from Monday.com's GraphQL API and loads it into our Fibonatix SQL Server database
  - Implemented 10+ modular ETL processes covering multiple business domains including:
    - Pricing data, merchant information, income tracking
    - Transaction classification, MCC codes
    - Risk velocity rules and security metrics
  - Built a resilient architecture using Polly for retry logic, GraphQL.Client for API integration, and OpsGenie for failure notifications
  - Designed a reusable base ETL pattern (Extract → Transform → Load) with proper error handling and logging

  2. Data Source Project (Database to BigQuery Sync)
  - Created a generic ETL framework that migrates data from our operational SQL database to BigQuery data warehouse
  - Implemented incremental sync using SyncProcess tracking to only process changed records, dramatically reducing processing time
  - Built 9+ ETL processes that handle transaction data, chargebacks, payment card information, client data, and more
  - Designed sophisticated BigQuery integration using:
    - Temp table strategy for safe MERGE operations
    - Batch processing (1000-record chunks) for optimal performance
    - ROW_NUMBER() deduplication logic to handle multiple versions
    - Cluster-aware updates for partition efficiency
  - Enabled the business to run analytics on historical operational data without impacting production database performance

  Part 2: Serverless Lambda Functions - Direct BigQuery Integration

  To improve efficiency and reduce database load, I architected and built serverless Lambda functions that fetch Monday.com data and write directly to BigQuery, completely bypassing database
  persistence:

  Key Achievements:
  - Eliminated database writes: Lambdas stream data directly to BigQuery's bronze layer (raw data warehouse), removing the need for intermediate SQL storage
  - Built specialized board fetchers:
    - Rejection Board processor with formula calculations
    - Activity Log processor with status change history enrichment
    - Generic "any board" fetcher for flexible board configurations
    - Monday Users fetcher with full replacement strategy
  - Implemented modern cloud-native architecture:
    - AWS SAM for infrastructure-as-code deployment
    - ARM64 runtime for cost optimization
    - 15-minute timeout support for large datasets
    - Automatic pagination and retry logic
  - Real-time data availability: Data lands in BigQuery within minutes of changes in Monday.com, enabling faster analytics

  Technical Impact:
  - Reduced complexity: Eliminated the two-step process (SQL → BigQuery) for Monday data
  - Improved performance: Parallel lambda execution vs sequential job processing
  - Lower costs: No database storage/compute for Monday data; direct cloud-to-cloud transfer
  - Better scalability: Stateless lambdas that scale automatically with EventBridge triggers

  Tech Stack Used:
  - C# (.NET 8.0), AWS Lambda, Google BigQuery
  - GraphQL.Client, Entity Framework Core, Polly (resilience)
  - AWS SAM, Docker (ARM64), EventBridge, CloudWatch




  My Work on Risk Automations & Security Metrics Automations

  Part 1: Risk Automation System

  I architected and built a comprehensive, real-time fraud prevention and risk management system that processes every transaction through multiple layers of automated validation, velocity checks, and
  intelligent rule enforcement.

  1. MS_RISK - Core Risk Evaluation Microservice

  What I Built:
  - Real-time transaction risk evaluation pipeline that processes thousands of transactions daily through automated validation layers
  - Multi-dimensional velocity check system that enforces transaction limits across:
    - Card numbers, emails, SSNs, IP addresses
    - Time periods: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, lifetime
    - Both count-based rules (number of transactions) and amount-based rules (transaction values)
  - BIN Attack Prevention System that automatically detects and blocks card testing attacks by monitoring:
    - Same BIN patterns from single IP addresses
    - Excessive transaction velocity from suspicious sources
    - Real-time blacklist management with Redis caching for sub-second response times
  - Intelligent Risk Validator with 69KB of sophisticated rule logic including:
    - Cardholder name vs. customer name matching
    - Age verification and minimum age enforcement
    - Temporary/disposable email domain detection
    - IP country vs. card issuer country mismatch detection
    - Virtual terminal transaction ratio limits

  Technical Implementation:
  - Built on .NET 8 with queue-based processing (Redis + SQS)
  - Processes from RedisQueueRisk → outputs to RedisQueueRoute (routing decisions) and RedisQueueRiskResponse
  - Route building algorithm that constructs complete transaction paths:
  Fibonatix → Brand → Channel → LogicHub → Connectors → Processors
  - MySQL database with Entity Framework Core (20-second command timeouts, retry-on-failure resilience)
  - Redis distributed caching for velocity rules and blacklists
  - OpenTelemetry integration for observability and monitoring

  Business Impact:
  - Prevents fraud losses: Real-time velocity enforcement stops card testing attacks before they succeed
  - Reduces chargebacks: Multi-layer validation catches suspicious patterns before transactions complete
  - Configurable rules: Database-driven rules allow business teams to adjust thresholds without code changes
  - Sub-second performance: Cached velocity checks with Redis for instant fraud detection

  2. MS_RISK_ALERT - Automated Risk Anomaly Detection

  What I Built:
  - 24/7 automated merchant risk monitoring system that analyzes transaction patterns and alerts on anomalies
  - 12+ Risk Performance Indicators (RPIs) tracking:
    - Chargeback ratios (count and amount vs. total sales)
    - Fraud-to-sales ratios
    - Refund-to-sales ratios
    - Negative transaction ratios (chargebacks + refunds vs. sales)
  - Flexible rule engine supporting:
    - Time-based analysis: daily, weekly, monthly periods
    - Scope-based rules: All brands, specific brands, groups, processors, or Fibonatix-level
    - Multiple operators: =, !=, <, <=, >, >=
    - Three value types: Amount-based, Count-based, Ratio-based
  - Real-time and batch processing:
    - ProcessTransaction(): Evaluates rules when transactions complete
    - ProcessAllRatioRules(): Daily batch analysis of all merchants
  - Alert lifecycle management: NotReviewed → Acknowledged → Resolved status tracking
  - OpsGenie integration for immediate notification of risk threshold breaches

  Technical Implementation:
  - ASP.NET Core web application with background worker pattern
  - Consumes from RedisQueueRiskAlert queue
  - Complex EF Core queries with entity relationships (brands, groups, transaction statuses)
  - In-memory caching for brand-group lookups to optimize performance
  - Alert deduplication per time period to prevent alert fatigue

  Business Impact:
  - Proactive risk management: Catches merchant issues before they escalate
  - Automated monitoring: No manual review needed for standard risk patterns
  - Flexible thresholds: Rules adapt to different merchant risk profiles
  - Reduced chargebacks: Early detection allows intervention before losses mount

  3. MS_SEC_ROUTE - Secure Request Routing

  What I Built:
  - Security-focused routing microservice that bridges non-secure and secure components
  - Handles sensitive operations including:
    - Credit card data storage and retrieval (encrypted)
    - Merchant credential management
    - Payment card information lookups
    - Synchronization tasks between secure/non-secure zones
  - Request-response correlation system using unique session IDs
  - Timeout management to prevent hanging requests
  - 8 routing types including SaveCreditCardData, GetMerchantData, SyncCredits, etc.

  Technical Implementation:
  - .NET 8 console application with worker service pattern
  - Queue architecture:
    - Input: RedisQueueMsSec (non-secure)
    - Secure output: RedisQueueDb (secure queue server)
    - Response handling via RedisQueueDbResponse → RedisMsSecResponsePrefix
  - Two routing methods:
    - RouteToSecureAsync<T>(): Fire-and-forget
    - RouteToSecureAndRespondAsync<T1, T2>(): Request-response with correlation
  - Comprehensive logging for audit trails

  Business Impact:
  - PCI DSS compliance: Separates secure/non-secure operations properly
  - Data protection: All sensitive data routed through secure channels
  - Reliability: Timeout protection and correlation tracking prevent data loss

  - Extracts merchant data from 3 Monday.com boards:
    - OnBoarding Funnel Board (merchant pipeline)
    - Application Form Board (merchant details)
    - Application Form SubItems Board (domains and company info)
    - PCI DSS Board (certification status tracking)
  - Creates SecurityMetrics accounts automatically via REST API when merchants onboard
  - Validates required data before account creation:
    - MerchantId, Email, City/Address
    - Multiple domain support
    - OpsGenie alerts for missing data
  - Tracks SecurityMetrics IDs in database for future reference

  2. PCI Certification Expiration Management
  - Monitors certification status across 4 states:
    - Empty status (new merchants)
    - "Account Created" (provisioned)
    - "Close To Expiration" (renewal needed)
    - "Non Compliant" (expired)
  - Queries SecurityMetrics API for SAQ (Self-Assessment Questionnaire) expiration dates
  - Auto-updates Monday.com "Review Date" column when newer dates found
  - Transitions status to "SaqCompleted" after compliance verification

  3. OAuth Integration with SecurityMetrics Platform
  - Built client credentials OAuth 2.0 flow
  - Token caching with 5-minute buffer before expiration
  - Two API endpoints:
    - POST /smapi/partners/{partnerId}/merchants - Account creation
    - GET /smapi/merchants/{id}/compliance - Expiration date retrieval

  Technical Implementation:
  - ETL Pattern: Extract → Transform → Load
    - Extract: GraphQL queries to Monday.com with pagination (50 items per page)
    - Transform: Deduplication by OnboardingItemId, domain grouping, data validation
    - Load: SecurityMetrics API calls, database persistence, Monday.com status updates
  - Integration Points:
    - Monday.com GraphQL API (board queries)
    - SecurityMetrics REST API (OAuth, account management, compliance queries)
    - MySQL database (SecurityMetrics table with SecurityId tracking)
    - OpsGenie (error alerting for validation failures)
  - Error Handling:
    - Comprehensive OpsGenie alerts prefixed with "RISK-Automation: [SecurityMetrics]"
    - Skips invalid records with detailed error messages
    - Tracks creation attempts and failures

  Data Flow:
  Monday.com Boards (GraphQL)
